In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, a common yet subtle bug arises when the data source changes unexpectedly, leading to inconsistencies in rendering.  This often manifests as missing items, duplicate items, or items appearing out of order.  The root cause is usually improper handling of the `data` prop's immutability.  For example, directly mutating the `data` array will not trigger a re-render, causing the list to remain unchanged even though the underlying data has been modified.

```javascript
// Incorrect: Directly mutating the array
this.state.data.push(newItem);

// Correct: Creating a new array
this.setState({ data: [...this.state.data, newItem] });
```
